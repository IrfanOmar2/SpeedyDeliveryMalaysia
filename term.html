                <br>
                8.2 Delivery Time<br>

An estimated delivery time will be provided to you in your email confirmation but delivery times shall vary depending on factors that are not controlled by us (e.g. order quantity, distance, time of day (peak periods), weather conditions, traffic conditions, etc.). You can view the remaining delivery time of an Order when you click on ‘My orders’ on the Platforms. You acknowledge that the delivery time we provide is only an estimate and Orders may arrive earlier or later. To ensure that you do not miss a delivery of an Order, you should ensure that either you or someone is at the delivery location to receive the Order once an Order is placed. If your Order contains Alcohol or Tobacco (if applicable) and you or the recipient is or appears to be below the legal age, or fails to provide a valid proof of ID, SpeedyDelivery reserves the right not to deliver your Order to you.
              </p>
